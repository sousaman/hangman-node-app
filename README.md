# Hangman (Node App)

## Description: 
Coding can be stressful. What better way to take a load off than playing some Hangman?! Its such a fun iconic game, but what if I told you its possible to play it from your command line?! Exciting stuff huh?

## How to Play:
You will be given the option to choose your difficulty.
Normal - You will be guessing the name of a college
Hard - You will be guessing the name of a college team's mascot.
The number of guesses you are given is equal to the number of characters in the name plus five

If you don't know how to play Hangman by now, you have bigger issues.
